# Code of Conduct

This project adopts a standard Code of Conduct to help ensure a welcoming
and respectful community for everyone. All contributors, maintainers and
participants are expected to follow these guidelines.

Expected behavior

- Be respectful, considerate, and collaborative.
- Assume good faith and provide constructive feedback.
- Use inclusive language and avoid derogatory or exclusionary remarks.

Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Abuse, insults, or personal attacks in issues, PRs, chat, or other channels.
- Posting private information or doxxing.

Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the
project maintainers by opening an issue labeled `private` or by contacting
the repository owner directly. Provide relevant context and any evidence.

Enforcement

Maintainers will review reports and take appropriate action, which may include
asking the contributor to revise behavior, temporarily blocking a user, or
removing content or access from the project. Decisions will be made at the
maintainers' discretion and with the goal of keeping the community safe.

Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (issues, pull requests,
discussions, chat channels, and community events) and to behavior in other
spaces when it has a direct and negative impact on the project or its
contributors.

Acknowledgements

This policy is a short, project-specific Code of Conduct intended to be
practical and actionable. For a more detailed reference, projects often use
the Contributor Covenant (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
